In this nonsense paragraph (taken from http://27bslash6.com/1000characters.html) is a thousand word paragraph. This will be used for testing encrypt & decrypt times for our program: Writing rubbish on the internet amuses me a lot. There is often a limit of 1000 characters per post so every story (including punctuation, spaces, introduction, proposal, argument and punch line) has to be within a small paragraph. Sometimes I just write nonsense and other times I make up something insensitive to evoke angry responses: When I was just fourteen, I was given the task of drowning kittens by my girlfriend's mother. I filled a large laundry sink with room temperature water and held the eight kittens under. As each kitten died and sank to the bottom, it turned and rested 'snuggled' to the previous. I put them in a garbage bag and was carrying it out when the bag moved and I heard a meow. I opened the bag and found one kitten had survived. So I drowned it again. And that is an exact one thousand.
