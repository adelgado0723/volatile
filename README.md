## About

This is a collection of some applications that I worked on as an undergraduate
Computer Science student at Florida International University. The applications
can be found under the section for their corresponding category. Those
categories are:

- Web/Network 

- Security

- Data Analysis



## [Geek Peek](https://github.com/adelgado0723/portfolio/tree/master/GeekPeek) 

- An online book store for geeks

- Developed in a *Scrum/Agile* team
	
- Technologies and Concepts:
	
	- Python
	
	- Django
	
	- SQLite
	
	- Javascript
	
	- CSS 
	
	- Bootstrap

## [Werewolf!](https://github.com/adelgado0723/portfolio/tree/master/Werewolf) 

- Text-based game that takes place in a chat environment

- Client/Server format

- Technologies and Concepts:
	
	- Python
	
	- Native Sockets
	
	- Tkinter GUI
	
	- Multithreading and Synchronization 


## [Decision Tree Generator](https://github.com/adelgado0723/portfolio/tree/master/DecisionTreeGenerator)

- Decision Trees are a way of finding correlations in people's behavior from
  data about their habits. 
		
	- Examples:	
		
		- The majority of customers that buy diapers, buy beer as well
		
		- The majority of customers that are students, regardless of
		  credit, buy a laptop computer

- Builds a decision tree based on a provided input file
	
- Proceeds to classify a tuple of data based on the decision tree.

- Technologies and Concepts:
	
	- Java
	
	- *ID3* Decision Tree Induction Algorithm 
	
## [Text-In-Image Steganography](https://github.com/adelgado0723/portfolio/tree/master/Text-In-ImageSteganography)
	
- Steganography is the practice of hiding a message inside of some form of
  media 
	
	- Examples:
		- Hiding an ASCII text message inside of an image
		- Hiding an image inside of a video
			
- This application was developed to test how the encoding algorithm performs 
  with a varying number of CPU cores.

- Technologies and Concepts:
	
	- C

	- Multiprocessing with MPI Library
	
	- Steganography Using Least-Significant Bit Encoding

	- Bitmap Image Manipulation

## [RSA Text-File Encryption](https://github.com/adelgado0723/portfolio/tree/master/RSAText-FileEncryption)

- The RSA algorithm for encryption draws its strength from the *Fundamental
  Theorem Of Arithmetic*, which states that any positive integer either is a
  prime number or can be uniquely represented as a product of prime numbers.

- In order to *crack* the encryption provided by the RSA algorithm, one
  must attempt to factor a very large number into its unique prime
  constituents; a lengthy process with no straight-forward easy solution 

- Technologies and Concepts:
	
	- Java

	- *Euclid's Algorithm* for finding GCD 
		
	- *Chinese Remainder Theorem* for fast modular exponentiation

	- Properties of prime numbers
	
	- Steganography using least-significant-bit encoding
